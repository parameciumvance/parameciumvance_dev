https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libnotify4
From Ubuntu's package description, we can find that, gnome-shell has been added to libnotify4's Recommended dependency in focal (Ubuntu20.04), resulting that, when you install libnotify4 in some way, gnome-shell is also installed.

Also notice that in jammy (Ubuntu22.04), gnome-shell in dependency has dropped from Recommended to Suggested. I think the package manager may have been aware of the problem and fixed it then.

My suggestion is that, when using Ubuntu server (20.04<=version<22.04),
always manually install the problematic libnotify4 in early setting
sudo apt install libnotify4 --no-install-recommends
This prevents unintentionally installing gnome-shell as dependency afterward.
